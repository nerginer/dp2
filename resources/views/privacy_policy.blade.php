<h3>Information Practices</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">MakerStorage understands that security and privacy are important issues for visitors to their web site (the “Site”) and recognizes their obligations to keep your information secure and confidential. That is why the MakerStorage maintains the following standards to help protect information that personally identifies you.</p>

<h3>Collection of Information</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may be asked to voluntarily provide your name, address, phone number, email address or other personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) to have access to some features of the Site. You may always refuse to provide your Personal Information, and this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain offerings, services or products. We or our business partners may also collect information that is anonymous, such as your IP address (a number used to identify your computer on the Internet) or the type of browser you are using (“Anonymous Information”), through the use of cookies or by other means. We hope that, by using Anonymous Information, we can update the site to make it more useful to you and other users. We reserve the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Anonymous Information, without limitation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Use of Information MakerStorage uses your Personal Information for the following purposes: to process your requests; to administer and improve the Site and related services; to notify you of our offerings, services and products that maybe of interest to you; to provide Internet security; and to meet legal requirements. MakerStorage may work with associated businesses which may perform certain functions on our behalf, such as sending email messages, managing data, processing credit card payments or providing services to users. These businesses have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to perform these specific functions and may not use it for any other purpose. We may use third party advertising companies to place ads on the Site and to place our ads on other web sites. If MakerStorage is involved in the sale of a substantial portion of its business assets, Anonymous or Personal Information maybe among the transferred assets.</p>

<h3>Privacy of Children</h3>

We strictly adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personal Information from any child under the age of 13 in any manner that violates this law.</p>

We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that could be shared by those sites.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

All Personal Information is stored on our secured servers, behind a firewall at a data center with access to data strictly controlled. Any unauthorized use of the Site may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution.</p>

<h3>Phishing Scams</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a policy of MakerStorage to not send unsolicited emails seeking certain highly sensitive personal information, such as social security number, date of birth or credit card number. In the event you receive such an email, and you have not previously been in direct contact with its sender, please do not respond and do not open any attachments as they may contain malicious code that will infect your computer.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Policy</h3>
